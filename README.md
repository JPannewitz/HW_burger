## Description on how to use the app
The burger app allows the user to add a type of burger using a form and submit button.  The burger then shows up to the left of the page with a "Eat me" button, allowing the user to eat the burger.  The eaten burger then moves to the right of the page.

## Requirements

- Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, Bootstrap & CSS for the layout
- Javascript/JQuery to dynamically update HTML
- Node.js
- Modules: express, body-parser, path
- MySQL
- Handlebars

## Code Explaination
